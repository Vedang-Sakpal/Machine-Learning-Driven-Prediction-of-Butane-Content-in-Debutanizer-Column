# Debutanizer Soft Sensor using LSTM and Bi-LSTM

This project focuses on developing data-driven soft sensors for a **debutanizer column** using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)** neural networks. The objective is to estimate hard-to-measure process variables using historical and real-time plant data, improving process monitoring and control in an industrial setting.

## üîç Project Overview

Soft sensors (or virtual sensors) are machine learning models that estimate unmeasurable or infrequently measured variables using readily available process data. This project applies LSTM-based deep learning models to build soft sensors for a debutanizer column in a refinery, which separates C4/C5 hydrocarbons.
